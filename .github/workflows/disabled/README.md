# Disabled Workflows

These workflows are temporarily disabled while we get the basic CI/CD working.
They can be re-enabled later by moving them back to the parent directory.

## Disabled workflows:
- ci-cd-pipeline.yml - Original complex pipeline (has issues)
- ci-cd-pipeline-fixed.yml - First fix attempt (still has issues)
- rollback.yml - Needs proper setup
- security-audit.yml - Needs dependencies configured
- health-check.yml - Needs monitoring setup

## Active workflow:
- ci-cd-simplified.yml - Working simplified pipeline
- ci.yml - Basic CI (working)
