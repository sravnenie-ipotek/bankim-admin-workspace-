# üö® Critical Questions for BankIM Development Team - JSONB Migration

**Date**: January 2025  
**Priority**: URGENT - Required before implementation  
**Context**: Admin panel needs to migrate to JSONB dropdown system

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Infrastructure Questions

### 1. **Database Synchronization**
- **Q1.1**: Does the admin panel share the same database as the main BankIM application, or does it use a separate database?
- **Q1.2**: If separate, how should synchronization work between the main app's `dropdown_configs` table and the admin panel?
- **Q1.3**: Is there a read-replica setup we should be aware of?

### 2. **Migration Status**
- **Q2.1**: Is the JSONB migration already live in production for the main application?
- **Q2.2**: Are there any dropdowns still using the old `content_items` system in production?
- **Q2.3**: What's the current state of the `dropdown_configs` table - fully populated or partially migrated?

### 3. **Database Access**
- **Q3.1**: Which database should the admin panel connect to for JSONB dropdowns:
  - `CONTENT_DATABASE_URL` (current)
  - `CORE_DATABASE_URL`
  - `MANAGEMENT_DATABASE_URL`
  - Or a new connection string?
- **Q3.2**: Do we have write permissions to the `dropdown_configs` table from the admin panel?

## üîå API & Integration Questions

### 4. **Existing JSONB Endpoints**
- **Q4.1**: Are the JSONB endpoints mentioned in the report (`/api/dropdowns/{screen}/{language}`) already implemented in the main app?
- **Q4.2**: Should the admin panel use these existing endpoints or create its own?
- **Q4.3**: Is there an authentication layer we need to consider when accessing these endpoints?

### 5. **Admin-Specific Endpoints**
- **Q5.1**: Should we create separate admin endpoints for JSONB management (e.g., `/api/admin/dropdown-configs/`)?
- **Q5.2**: Or should we extend the existing endpoints with admin capabilities?
- **Q5.3**: Are there any rate limiting or permission considerations for admin operations?

## üíæ Data & Content Questions

### 6. **Content Types**
- **Q6.1**: The report focuses on dropdowns, but what about other content types (text, links, steps)?
- **Q6.2**: Should we maintain a hybrid approach where dropdowns use JSONB but other content uses the old system?
- **Q6.3**: Is there a plan to migrate ALL content types to JSONB eventually?

### 7. **Screen Identifiers**
- **Q7.1**: Can you provide a complete list of all `screen_location` values that need migration?
- **Q7.2**: Are the screen identifiers consistent between the main app and admin panel?
- **Q7.3**: How do we handle new screens that might be added during migration?

### 8. **Language Support**
- **Q8.1**: The report shows 3 languages (en, he, ru). Are there plans to add more languages?
- **Q8.2**: How should the system handle missing translations - fallback to English or show an error?
- **Q8.3**: Should all three languages be mandatory when creating/editing dropdowns?

## üîÑ Migration & Rollback Questions

### 9. **Migration Strategy**
- **Q9.1**: Should we run a one-time migration script or implement a gradual migration?
- **Q9.2**: How do we handle dropdowns that are edited in the old system after JSONB migration starts?
- **Q9.3**: Is there a specific order in which screens should be migrated?

### 10. **Rollback Plan**
- **Q10.1**: If something goes wrong, can we rollback to the old system?
- **Q10.2**: Should we maintain both systems in parallel during transition?
- **Q10.3**: How long should we keep the old data as backup?

### 11. **Feature Flags**
- **Q11.1**: Is there an existing feature flag system in place?
- **Q11.2**: Should we implement `USE_JSONB_ADMIN=true` as suggested, or use a different mechanism?
- **Q11.3**: How do we coordinate feature flag activation between main app and admin panel?

## üß™ Testing & Validation Questions

### 12. **Testing Environment**
- **Q12.1**: Is there a staging environment with JSONB structure already set up?
- **Q12.2**: Can we get access to test data that matches production structure?
- **Q12.3**: Are there existing test cases we should be aware of?

### 13. **Validation Rules**
- **Q13.1**: What validation rules should be applied to JSONB data?
- **Q13.2**: Are there any business rules about dropdown options (min/max count, value formats)?
- **Q13.3**: Should we validate that all dropdown values match any existing business logic?

## ‚ö° Performance & Caching Questions

### 14. **Caching Strategy**
- **Q14.1**: Is Redis already configured for the admin panel?
- **Q14.2**: Should cache invalidation be automatic or manual after edits?
- **Q14.3**: How should cache keys be structured for JSONB data?

### 15. **Performance Requirements**
- **Q15.1**: What are the acceptable response times for dropdown operations?
- **Q15.2**: Is the 100ms target mentioned in the report a hard requirement?
- **Q15.3**: Should we implement pagination for large dropdown lists?

## üîê Security & Permissions Questions

### 16. **Access Control**
- **Q16.1**: Are there role-based permissions for editing different types of dropdowns?
