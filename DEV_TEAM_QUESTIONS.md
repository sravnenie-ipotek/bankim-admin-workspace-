# üîß TECHNICAL: Credit & Credit-Refi Database Investigation

## Database Analysis

### Current Database State:

#### 1. **Credit Section (5.1.x)** - 342 content items
- **14 pages total** in navigation hierarchy
- **Only 2 pages have translations** (45% overall coverage):
  - ‚úÖ `credit_step1` - fully translated (135 translations)
  - ‚úÖ `credit_summary` - fully translated (36 translations)
- **12 pages with ZERO translations**:
  - ‚ùå credit_phone_verification
  - ‚ùå credit_personal_data
  - ‚ùå credit_partner_personal
  - ‚ùå credit_partner_income
  - ‚ùå credit_income_employed
  - ‚ùå credit_coborrower_personal
  - ‚ùå credit_coborrower_income
  - ‚ùå credit_loading_screen
  - ‚ùå credit_program_selection
  - ‚ùå credit_registration_page
  - ‚ùå credit_login_page
  - ‚ùå reset_password_page

#### 2. **Credit-Refi Section (6.1.x)** - 363 content items
- **20 pages total** (14 main + 6 child pages)
- **Only 1 page has partial translations** (5% overall coverage):
  - üü° `credit_refi_step1` - 44% translated (54 translations out of 123 needed)
- **19 pages with ZERO translations**:
  - ‚ùå All other credit_refi pages have no translations at all

### What We Did:

1. **Removed 1,033 generic placeholder translations** that were misleading:
   - Deleted entries like "–î–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–µ–¥–≤–∏–∂–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ - –≠–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç 1" (Property Details - Item 1)
   - These were confusing users as they showed real estate terms in credit sections
   - Now pages show empty translations instead of wrong content

2. **Added meaningful translations** for `credit_summary` page:
   - Created proper credit-related terms instead of placeholders
   - Example: "–°—É–º–º–∞ –∫—Ä–µ–¥–∏—Ç–∞" (Loan Amount) instead of generic text

3. **Fixed API endpoints** to show draft translations when available:
   - Modified drill endpoints to include both approved and draft status
   - Ensures admin portal reflects actual database state

### The Problem:

**The admin portal must reflect the real application**, but currently:

1. **Credit section**: 12 out of 14 pages show NO content in drill view
2. **Credit-Refi section**: 19 out of 20 pages show NO content in drill view
3. **Users see empty pages** when trying to view/edit these sections
4. **For comparison**: Mortgage sections have 100% translation coverage and work perfectly

## üî¥ CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR DEV TEAM:

### 1. Are these sections supposed to be live?
- Is Credit (5.1.x) active in production?
- Is Credit-Refi (6.1.x) active in production?
- If not, when are they planned to go live?

### 2. Where is the content for these pages?
- Do you have the actual field labels and content for the 31 untranslated pages?
- Is this content in another database/system?
- Should we copy content from mortgage sections and adapt it?

### 3. What should these pages contain?
For example, `credit_refi_step2` has 34 content items but zero translations. What should these items be:
- Form field labels?
- Help text?
- Button labels?
- Error messages?

### 4. Priority order?
Which pages are most critical to translate first:
- Registration/login flows?
- Main application steps?
- Summary/confirmation pages?

### 5. Content source?
- Should we use the mortgage translations as a template?
- Do you have a spreadsheet/document with the correct translations?
- Who can provide the proper content for these sections?

## üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:

**Option A:** Provide translations for all 31 pages (we need ~700 content items translated into RU/HE/EN)

**Option B:** Mark these sections as "under development" in the admin portal

**Option C:** Copy and adapt mortgage content as temporary placeholder

**Option D:** Disable these sections until content is ready

---

**Please advise on how to proceed. The admin portal currently shows empty pages for most credit and credit-refi sections, which impacts content managers trying to work with these sections.**

**Database is ready**, **structure is correct**, we just need the actual content/translations to make these sections functional.
